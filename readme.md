TODO APP
---

A simple todo app that you can manage your daily schedule.

For know you can mark an todo item as done or undone or delete it from your list.

To run application locally;
- ```git clone ...```
- ```npm install```
- ```npm run start```

If you want to just build the app, instead of ```npm run start``` run ```npm run build```.

```npm run start``` command is powered by ```webpack-dev-server```. You can run the app without building it. Also when you do changes, you don't need to re-run the command. ```webpack-dev-server-``` will pick up the changes automatically.
